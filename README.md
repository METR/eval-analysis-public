# DVC Pipeline

## Quickstart

First, start your dev container to ensure access to all the necessary dependencies. Two notes:
1. This may take a bit of time (10+ minutes). It will be much quicker the second time you run it.
2.  Sometimes the `viv-cli` package fails to install. If this happens, just try rebuilding your dev container.

External users may then simply `dvc repro` to run the pipeline.
